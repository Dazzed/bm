- Error with withdraw limit





-In the on boarding flow, the #’ selection is now incorrect
NOT CLEAR ENOUGH TO UNDERSTAND



Deposit and Withdrawal buttons in settings still don’t work



-When there is no input within the DOB, SSN, etc. boxes we made a change to make the numbers grey, they are now
black again

-At the end of the flow I am unable to select the I agree button, thus not allowing me to complete the on boarding
