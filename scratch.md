1) ALL lists that showing diamonds have text that are not centered or aligned with their respective diamond (country of citizenship, state selections on "address" page, )

2) All of the headers need to match the positioning and styling of the "Address" page. For example: on the "phone number" page the page title "PHONE NUMBER" should be placed in the same vertical position as the page titles in the previous pages (name and address are perfect); so in this case, "PHONE NUMBER" and the "why we ask" box should be moved up ALSO the grey box that "PHONE NUMBER" and the "why we ask" box is contained in dips too low and should match the previous pages, and as a result it pushes up the rest of the content below when entering the phone number ----should apply to all pages

6) the DOB page the whole number pad should be showing, not select numbers. greying them out (to make it unselectable) is fine, but not completely taking them out and making them invisible; refer to the mock-ups

9) single should be the top option on the list on the marital status page (and the default selection as it already is)

13) the "account details" page should come right AFTER the "investment experience" step/page, with the "terms & policies" page coming after the "account details" page, as shown in the design flow

14) please remove the redundancy of saying "email" and "password" twice on the account details page (get rid of the placeholder text in the form

15) there should be just a tad bit more spacing between the 3 password criteria as shown in the image below

16) change: Upper & Lowercase Letters --> Upper & lowercase letters on the account details page

18) the "account details" page should have a header of "Identity" as shown in the mock-ups, NOT "Terms & Conditions"

19) on the page that shows the 4 terms and policies, the header should be "Terms & Policies" as shown in the mock-ups, NOT "Identity"

21) on the "check your inbox" page, there should not be a grey box as shown in the mock-ups

22.) form level errors for password at enrollment are not working anymore
