-Deposit and Withdrawal buttons in settings still don’t work
I can't reproduce this.

Works for me. Please send detailed info on your device. Exact model, etc. Description of how it fails.

-In the on boarding flow, “Alabama” is selected as the state, but it should be “Select”
Fixed

-In the on boarding flow, the #’ selection is now incorrect
I've fixed the styling if that's what you mean... It's gonna be janky becuase all the heights are hard coded.

-When there is no input within the DOB, SSN, etc. boxes we made a change to make the numbers grey, they are now black again
Fixed

-At the end of the flow I am unable to select the I agree button, thus not allowing me to complete the on boarding
I can't reproduce this. Please provide more detail.
